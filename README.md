# TTT
Tic Tac Toe

This is an implementation of the TTT game using only ONE array as the data structure.

The array stores all the inputs from the user.

The array is dynamic which means the user can pick the size of the board.

The board is not necessary to be NxN, and winning is only using Rows and columns.

To win a diagonal Of course the Board needs to be NxN.

The operations to dealing with rows ans columns are performed on the same one dimentional original array.

This is of coarse NOT THE BEST IMPLEMENTATION.

The MAIN goal of this application is to perform TWO DIMENTIONAL OPERATIONS using ONE DIMENTIONAL data structure (an array).
